# 👋 Hi there, I'm Filip!

I'm a Swedish **Software Engineer** with a background in **Computer Science** and **Electrical Engineering** who works at [Pitch Technologies](https://pitchtechnologies.com/). I'm passionate about building scalable software systems, sustainable codebases, and continuously learning new technologies. I love to dive into what I don't know and figure things out as I solve the problems I create for myself.

- 🔧 Professionally, I work with distributed simulation software using **Java**, **React.js**, and **HLA**
- 🌱 At home, I explore **self-hosting**, **networking**, and **machine learning**
- 🧪 Active project: I'm building a compute cluster using **Kubernetes** on Raspberry Pis for job deployment and experimentation.
- 🔐 Active project: Expanding and refining my **self-hosted infrastructure**, investigating hybrid hosting solutions between on-prem and cloud
- 🍺 **Homebrewing beer** and **cooking** to wind down

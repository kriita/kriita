# 👋 Hi there, I'm Filip!

I'm a Swedish **Software Engineer** with a background in **Computer Science** and **Electrical Engineering**, passionate about building scalable software systems, sustainable codebases, and continuously learning new technologies. I love to dive into what I don't know and figure things out as I solve the problems I create for myself.

## What I Do

Professionally, I focus on:

- 🔧 **Software Development & Architecture**
- ⚙️ **Distributed Simulation Systems** - specifically the HLA standard
- 🌐 **Web Development & Infrastructure**

Outside of work, I explore:

- 🏡 **Homelabbing** — running Proxmox on custom hardware
- ☁️ **Self-hosting** tools and services for privacy, learning, and control
- 🍺 **Homebrewing** and **music** to wind down

## Projects in Progress

- 🧪 Building a compute cluster using **Kubernetes** on Raspberry Pis for job deployment and experimentation.
- 🔐 Expanding and refining my **self-hosted infrastructure**, currently focusing on real-world reliability

## Currently Learning

- 🛠️ **Hybrid software hosting** for sustainable self-hosted setups
- 🔒 Systems **security**, especially with regards to public hosting from home
- ♻ **Maintenance** strategies for legacy code systems
